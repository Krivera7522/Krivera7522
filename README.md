### Hi there, my name is Krystal Rivera ðŸ‘‹
#### Here is a little bit about me:

> I come from Puerto Rico, my undergraduate background is in Mechanical engineering, and I completed my bachelor's in 2021. My experience and expertise have led me to work in the aviation industry. I have worked for a company named 'Draken', that plays the adversary role in military training. I was part of their Engineering Modification team, where I designed and managed the upgrades for their planes from start to finish, completed many reverse engineering projects, and helped researched alternatives solution using additive manufacturing technicques. If you want to explore a little more, here is a link to an article written about it: ['Skyâ€™s the limit for students in tactical fighter aircraft internship'](https://floridapoly.edu/news/articles/2020/09/091020-drakeninternship.php). After I finished my internship there, I went to work at an Airline as a technical support and engineering intern, where I worked directly under the 'Senior Director of Maintenance' and was in charge of creating the maintenance programs for their cargo and passenger ATR fleet.

>  I am currently working on completing a Master's in Engineering Management on a 10 month acceleerated program, which I will have finished by June 24, 2022.

Below is a list of additional information:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on completing my Global Strategic Management & Leadership, and Data Visualization and Reproducible Research classes.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m presently learning how to use many R libraries such as ggplot2 to narrate stories through data visualizations.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love groot from guardians of the galaxy, I love to play volleyball, and the beach is one of my favorite places.

Thank you for reading, here is some eye candy :grinning:
